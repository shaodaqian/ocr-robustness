# Robustness Guarantees on Deep Neural Networks for Optical Character Recognition

# Abstract
Recent studies have shown that state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we study the robustness of OCR neural networks which comprise of convolution layers to obtain spatial features and recurrent layers to capture relations between frames. In particular, we focus on the Maximum Safe Radius problem, which computes the minimum distance to an adversarial example given an input sample, and the Feature Robustness problem, which gives comparisons of robustness against adversarial perturbation between features of an input sample. We show that when provided with the Lipschitz constant of the network, this problem can be approximated with guarantees using finite optimisation by discretizing the input space. This optimisation problem can be solved using a two-player turn-based game where the first player chooses a feature and the second player imposes a perturbation within that feature. We also exploit output range analysis methods to compute a lower bound of the Maximum Safe Radius and draw comparisons between the two robustness certification methods. Furthermore, we investigate methods to estimate the Lipschitz constants and evaluate how better bounds for the Lipschitz constant affect the performance of the game-based algorithm. Finally, experiments are conducted on the ICDAR13 dataset.
